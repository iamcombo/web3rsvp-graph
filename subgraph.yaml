# The subgraph manifest (subgraph.yaml) is where you can define settings for the subgraph. 
# Most of this will already be filled out for you, but there are a few changes we need to make.

# Under dataSources, you can see our contract address and abi. We can add another property here called startBlock, which we will set to the block number when this contract was first deployed. 
# Adding a start block reduces the amount of time it takes to index data for your subgraph.
