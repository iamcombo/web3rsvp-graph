# We have 4 entities: Event, Account, RSVP, and Confirmation. 
# Each entity must be defined with the @entity tag. 
# You can think of an entity like an object. 
# It’s a “thing” that has keys and values, with each key being a schema field that can be queried for its value.

#  Each field has a type, and if it’s required it has a “!” (the value can’t be null).

# In the Event and Account entities for the rsvps and confirmedAttendees fields we are using a special keyword @derivedFrom, 
# also called a reverse lookup, which allows us to reference data from another entity.
